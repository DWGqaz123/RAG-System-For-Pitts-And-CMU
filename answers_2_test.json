In 1794, a group of rebels, led by David Bradford, robbed the U.S. mail as it left Pittsburgh, hoping to discover who in the town opposed them. The rebels also called for a military assembly to meet at Braddock's Field, which is near Pittsburgh.\n\nThe federal government ultimately suppressed the rebellion, and the episode was viewed as a success by the Washington administration. However, the whiskey excise remained difficult to collect, and many westerners continued to refuse to pay the tax.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Whiskey Rebellion Festival is still held annually in Washington, Pennsylvania, which is near Pittsburgh, and features live music, food, and historic reenactments.",
