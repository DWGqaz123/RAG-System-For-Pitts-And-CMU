In 1791, a preliminary meeting was held at Redstone Old Fort in Fayette County, which called for the selection of delegates to a more formal assembly in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh convention, which convened in early September 1791, was dominated by moderates who hoped to prevent the outbreak of violence. The convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to the Pennsylvania Assembly and the U.S. House of Representatives, both located in Philadelphia.\\n\\nIn August 1792, a second convention was held in Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention, and it led to the formation of a militant group known as the Mingo Creek militia. The militia, led by David Bradford, was responsible for several violent incidents, including the robbery of the U.S. mail and the attack on the fortified home of a tax collector.\\n\\nThe Whiskey Rebellion ultimately led to a march on Pittsburgh, where a large crowd of protesters gathered at Braddock's Field in August 1794. The crowd, which consisted primarily of poor people who owned no land, was angry about the whiskey excise and other economic grievances. The event was a significant challenge to the authority of the federal government, and it ultimately led to the deployment of federal troops to suppress the rebellion.\\n\\nIn popular culture, the Whiskey Rebellion has been referenced in several works, including a stage musical written by Susanna Rowson and a comedy track recorded by W.C.

This suggests that the Allegheny County Courthouse is likely the physical location where this court operates.\\n\\nAdditionally, in Source 4, Rich Fitzgerald, the President of the Allegheny County Council, is mentioned as a notable alumnus of Carnegie Mellon University. This does not provide direct information about the role of the Allegheny County Courthouse but suggests that the county council, which may be located in the courthouse, has a connection to the university.\\n\\nTherefore, while the exact role of the Allegheny County Courthouse is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that it is likely a location for the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County and possibly the Allegheny County Council.\",\n",

      "    \"150\": \"Pittsburgh's economic significance today is multifaceted. The city's revenue streams are diverse, with various sectors contributing to its economic growth.\\n\\nOne significant source of revenue is the parking tax, which is forecast to increase by 4.0 percent each year through 2029. Additionally, the city's amusement tax revenues are expected to grow by 2.5 percent annually through 2029, driven by the local service tax and consumer price index (inflation).\\n\\nThe local service tax, a weekly tax of $1 per employee working within the City of Pittsburgh, is another contributor to the city's revenue. Furthermore, the city's deed transfer tax revenues are budgeted at $42.3 million in 2025, although this represents a 28.4 percent decrease compared to the previous year.\\n\\nThe city's economy is also driven by its industrial heritage, with Andrew Carnegie's steel industry legacy playing a significant role. Carnegie's philanthropic efforts, including the establishment of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, have contributed to the city's cultural and educational landscape.\\n\\nThe city's economic indicators, such as the gross Allegheny County product, serve as a broad economic indicator of activity in and around the City. The total parking tax revenues and amusement tax revenues are forecast to increase annually, indicating a growing economy.\\n\\nHowever, it is worth noting that the city's assessed value decreased by 4.7 percent in 2024, which may have a negative impact on the city's revenue. Nevertheless, the city's economic significance remains strong, driven by its diverse revenue streams and industrial heritage.\",\n",

      "    \"156\": \"The Roberto Clemente Bridge, also known as the Sixth Street Bridge, is a steel arch bridge that spans the Allegheny River in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The bridge's history is closely tied to the city's industrial and cultural heritage.\\n\\nThe bridge was originally built in 1926 as a steel arch bridge, connecting the city's downtown area to the South Side. It was a major transportation artery, carrying both vehicular and pedestrian traffic.\\n\\nIn 1966, the bridge was renamed the Sixth Street Bridge, and in 1977, it was renamed again in honor of Roberto Clemente, the legendary Pittsburgh Pirates baseball player who tragically died in a plane crash in 1972.\\n\\nHowever, the Roberto Clemente Bridge has a deeper history that predates its modern name. The area where the bridge now stands was once the site of Fort Duquesne, a French fort established in 1754 at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. The fort was later taken over by the British and eventually developed into the city of Pittsburgh.\\n\\nThe bridge's location also holds significance in the context of Andrew Carnegie's philanthropic efforts. Carnegie, a Scottish-American industrialist and philanthropist, played a significant role in the development of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. He was a major benefactor of the city's steel industry and invested heavily in the construction of bridges, roads, and other infrastructure projects.\\n\\nIn summary, the Roberto Clemente Bridge has a rich history that spans centuries, from its origins as a steel arch bridge in the 1920s to its modern-day significance as a tribute to Roberto Clemente. The bridge's location also holds importance in the context of Pittsburgh's industrial and cultural heritage, as well as Andrew Carnegie's philanthropic efforts in the region.\",\n",
