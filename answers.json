The French then razed the existing fort and built Fort Duquesne in its place.\n\nAnother significant event was the Battle of Fort Duquesne in September 1758, where a reconnaissance force led by Major James Grant was soundly defeated by the French. However, this defeat was followed by the eventual abandonment of the fort by the French in November 1758, as they were unable to hold it due to the loss of Native American support.\n\nThe capture of Fort Duquesne by the British was a significant event, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

    "114": "The year 1758 holds significant importance in Pittsburgh's history due to the Forbes Expedition, a British military campaign led by Brigadier-General John Forbes. This expedition aimed to capture Fort Duquesne, a French fort established at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers.\n\nIn 1758, the Treaty of Easton caused a loss of Native American support for the French, ultimately leading to the French destroying Fort Duquesne before the expedition could arrive on November 24. The Forbes Expedition successfully built the Forbes Road while advancing to the fort, and the French abandonment of the fort marked a crucial turning point in the French and Indian War.\n\nAdditionally, in 1758, General John Forbes' troops passed through Shannopin's Town, observing the decapitated bodies of Scottish highlanders who had been killed at the Battle of Fort Duquesne. This event highlights the significant impact of the Forbes Expedition on the region's history.\n\nThe year 1758 is also notable for the Battle of Fort Duquesne, where the French initially had success against the English vanguard but were forced to abandon the fort in the face of the much superior size of Forbes' main force. This battle marked a significant shift in the control of the region and paved the way for the eventual British takeover of the area.\n\nOverall, the year 1758 is a pivotal moment in Pittsburgh's history, marking the beginning of the end of French control in the region and setting the stage for the city's future growth and development.",

    "116": "The Whiskey Rebellion was a violent tax protest in the United States that began in 1791 and ended in 1794. It was a response to the federal government's imposition of a tax on whiskey, which was a major product of the western frontier. The tax, known as the whiskey tax, was intended to generate revenue to pay the war debt incurred during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nPittsburgh played a significant role in the Whiskey Rebellion. In 1791, a preliminary meeting was held at Redstone Old Fort in Fayette County, which called for the selection of delegates to a more formal assembly in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh convention, which convened in early September 1791, was dominated by moderates who hoped to prevent the outbreak of violence. The convention sent a petition for redress of grievances to the Pennsylvania Assembly and the U.S. House of Representatives, both located in Philadelphia.\n\nIn August 1792, a second convention was held in Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention, and it led to the formation of a militant group known as the Mingo Creek militia. The militia, led by David Bradford, was responsible for several violent incidents, including the robbery of the U.S. mail and the attack on the fortified home of a tax collector.\n\nThe Whiskey Rebellion ultimately led to a march on Pittsburgh, where a large crowd of protesters gathered at Braddock's Field in August 1794. The crowd, which consisted primarily of poor people who owned no land, was angry about the whiskey excise and other economic grievances. The event was a significant challenge to the authority of the federal government, and it ultimately led to the deployment of federal troops to suppress the rebellion.\n\nIn popular culture, the Whiskey Rebellion has been referenced in several works, including a stage musical written by Susanna Rowson and a comedy track recorded by W.C. Fields. The rebellion has also been the subject of historical debate, with some historians arguing that Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton deliberately provoked the uprising by issuing subpoenas just before the law was made less onerous.",
    "117": "Pittsburgh's geography played a significant role in its industrial growth. The city's location at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, where they form the Ohio River, made it an ideal spot for industrial development. The rivers provided a source of water power, which was essential for powering the machinery and factories that drove the city's growth.\n\nAdditionally, the city's geography facilitated the transportation of goods and raw materials. The rivers allowed for easy access to the Ohio River and the Gulf of Mexico, making it a hub for trade and commerce. The city's location also made it a strategic point for the production and transportation of iron and steel products, which were in high demand during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe area's natural resources, including coal and iron ore, were also readily available, making it an attractive location for industries such as steel production. The city's geography also made it a center for wartime production, with the demand for iron products, such as armor for gunboats, cannons, and shells, driving the growth of industries such as steel production.\n\nThe combination of these factors made Pittsburgh an ideal location for industrial growth, and the city's geography played a significant role in shaping its development into a major industrial center.",

Carnegie helped open the rail lines into Washington D.C. that the rebels had cut, and he personally supervised the transportation of the first brigade of Union troops to reach Washington D.C. following the defeat of Union forces at Bull Run.\n\nAdditionally, Pittsburgh citizens helped to defuse the threat of the Whiskey Rebellion, a protest that took place in August 1862, by banishing three men whose intercepted letters had given offense to the rebels and by sending a delegation to Braddock's Field that expressed support for the gathering. The protest was eventually limited to a defiant march through the town, with only Major Kirkpatrick's barns being burned.\n\nIt is worth noting that while Pittsburgh played a significant role during the American Civil War, the city itself was not a major battleground. However, the city's strategic location and its role as a transportation hub made it an important location for the Union war effort.",

It was one of the most serious labor disputes in U.S. history, centered on Carnegie Steel's main plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania. The conflict grew out of a labor dispute between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) and the Carnegie Steel Company.\n\nThe strike's historical significance can be seen in several aspects:\n\n1. **Labor rights and unionization**: The Homestead Strike marked a pivotal moment in the labor movement, highlighting the struggles of workers for better wages, working conditions, and union recognition. The strike's outcome, with the company successfully resuming operations with non-union immigrant employees, demonstrated the challenges faced by labor unions in the late 19th century.\n\n2. **Industrial relations and corporate power**: The strike exposed the tensions between industrialists like Andrew Carnegie and labor unions, showcasing the power dynamics at play in the steel industry. Carnegie's decision to leave mediation in the hands of his associate, Henry Clay Frick, who held anti-union sentiments, contributed to the conflict's escalation.\n\n3. **Government intervention and public opinion**: The strike led to government intervention, with Pennsylvania Governor Robert Pattison deploying state militia to the strike site. The event also sparked public debate about labor rights, corporate power, and the role of government in resolving industrial disputes.\n\n4. **Legacy and impact on Andrew Carnegie's reputation**: The Homestead Strike permanently damaged Andrew Carnegie's reputation, as he was seen as out of touch with the struggles of his workers. This event marked a turning point in Carnegie's philanthropic efforts, as he later focused on supporting education, libraries, and other causes that promoted social welfare.\n\nIn conclusion, the Homestead Strike was a significant event in U.S. labor history, highlighting the struggles of workers, the power of corporate interests, and the complexities of industrial relations.
