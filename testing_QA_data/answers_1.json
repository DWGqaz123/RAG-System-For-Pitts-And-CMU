The town had a small community still existing at that time, but it had vanished by the end of the year.\n* **Treaty of Easton**: The Treaty of Easton, concluded on October 26, 1758, marked a significant turning point in the history of the region. The treaty caused the remnants of the Lenape (Delaware), Mingo, and Shawnee tribes to abandon the French and set up the conditions that ultimately forced them to move westward once again.\n* **French strategic collapse**: The collapse of Native American support made it impossible for the French to hold Fort Duquesne and the Ohio Valley. The French abandoned and blew up the fort in mid-November 1758, marking the end of their control in the region.\n* **British conquest**: The year 1758 was a pivotal year in the British conquest of the region. The British replaced Fort Duquesne with Fort Pitt, which was built between 1759 and 1762.\n\nOverall, the year 1758 is significant in Pittsburgh's history as it marked the beginning of the end of French control in the region, the abandonment of Shannopin's Town, and the eventual British conquest of the area.",

However, the rebellion did have a significant impact on Pittsburgh, which was a small frontier settlement at the time.\n\nIn July 1794, a group of rebels, led by David Bradford, robbed the U.S. mail as it left Pittsburgh, hoping to discover who in the town opposed them. They found several letters that condemned the rebels, which further radicalized the countryside. The rebels then called for a military assembly to meet at Braddock's Field, which was near Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Whiskey Rebellion demonstrated that the new national government had the will and ability to suppress violent resistance to its laws. The events contributed to the formation of political parties in the United States and ultimately led to the repeal of the whiskey tax in the early 1800s.\n\nKey points related to Pittsburgh:\n\n* The U.S. mail was robbed as it left Pittsburgh by a group of rebels led by David Bradford.\n* The rebels found letters in the mail that condemned their actions, which further radicalized the countryside.\n* The rebels called for a military assembly to meet at Braddock's Field, which was near Pittsburgh.\n* The Whiskey Rebellion had a significant impact on the small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh, which was a key location for the rebels' activities.",

He adopted and adapted the Bessemer process, which allowed for the cheap and efficient mass production of steel. This innovation led to a significant drop in steel prices and the rapid adoption of Bessemer steel for rails.\n\nCarnegie's success in the steel industry was also due to his relationship with the railroad industries, which relied on steel for track and made money from steel transport. However, the specific significance of the year 1901 for Pittsburgh's steel industry remains unclear based on the provided context.\n\nIt's worth noting that Andrew Carnegie sold his steel company, Carnegie Steel, to J.P.
