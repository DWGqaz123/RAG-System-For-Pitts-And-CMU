During this battle, a reconnaissance force led by Major James Grant was soundly defeated by the French.\n\nAdditionally, the French ultimately abandoned and blew up Fort Duquesne in November 1758, as they were unable to hold the fort due to the loss of Native American support.\n\nThe capture of Fort Duquesne was a strategic objective of the Forbes Expedition, which was a British military campaign led by Brigadier-General John Forbes in 1758.",

It was the year when the Forbes Expedition, led by Brigadier-General John Forbes, approached Fort Duquesne, ultimately leading to the French abandoning and blowing up the fort on November 24, 1758. This event marked a crucial turning point in the French and Indian War, as the collapse of Native American support for the French made it impossible for them to hold Fort Duquesne and the Ohio Valley.\n\nAdditionally, the Forbes Expedition's passage through Shannopin's Town in 1758 is notable, as it was one of the last recorded observations of the town before it vanished.

    "116": "The Whiskey Rebellion was a violent tax protest in the United States that began in 1791 and ended in 1794. It was a response to the federal government's imposition of a tax on whiskey, which was the first tax on a domestic product.\n\nThe rebellion was not confined to western Pennsylvania, but it did have a significant impact on the region. In fact, the western counties of every other state in Appalachia, including Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, also opposed the whiskey tax.\n\nIn western Pennsylvania, particularly in the small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh, the federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax. Many small western distillers refused to pay the tax, and federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them faced opposition from the rebels.\n\nThe rebellion in western Pennsylvania was marked by violent resistance, including the robbery of the U.S. mail and the call for a military assembly to meet at Braddock's Field. The rebels also targeted local residents who assisted the federal government, including the \"tar and feathering\" of the tax collector.\n\nThe Whiskey Rebellion ultimately ended with the suppression of the rebels by the Washington administration, which demonstrated that the new national government had the will and ability to enforce its laws. The episode contributed to the formation of political parties in the United States and had a lasting impact on the country's politics and governance.\n\nIn terms of Pittsburgh's relationship to the Whiskey Rebellion, the city was a key location for the federal government's efforts to collect the whiskey tax. However, the city was also a hotbed of opposition to the tax, with many residents refusing to pay the tax and supporting the rebels.

The city's location at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, where they form the Ohio River, provided a unique advantage. This confluence created a natural transportation hub, allowing for easy access to waterways and facilitating the transportation of goods and raw materials.\n\nThe presence of the rivers also enabled the development of industries such as steel, which relied heavily on the availability of coal and iron ore. The rivers provided a source of power for mills and factories, and the surrounding hills and mountains offered a readily available supply of coal.\n\nAdditionally, the city's geography made it an ideal location for the development of the steel industry, which became a major driver of Pittsburgh's industrial growth. The combination of the rivers, coal deposits, and iron ore availability created a perfect storm for the growth of industries such as steel, which in turn drove the city's economic development.\n\nIt is worth noting that the city's geography also contributed to the development of the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, which was established in 1913 to conduct research for firms on a contractual basis. The institute's location in Pittsburgh, with its access to the rivers and surrounding resources, made it an ideal location for conducting research and development in industries such as steel and chemicals.",

It centered on a labor dispute between the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers (AA) and the Carnegie Steel Company at its main plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe strike was marked by violence, including a fight on July 6, 1892, in which 10 men – seven strikers and three Pinkerton agents – were killed and hundreds were injured. The conflict ultimately led to the deployment of state militia and the attempted assassination of Henry Clay Frick, the associate and partner of Andrew Carnegie.\n\nThe Homestead Strike is significant because it highlighted the tensions between labor and management during the Industrial Revolution in the United States. It also led to changes in labor laws and practices, including the establishment of pension funds for workers by Andrew Carnegie in 1901.\n\nIn terms of its broader historical context, the Homestead Strike was part of a larger wave of labor unrest and strikes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including the Pullman Strike of 1894 and the Lawrence Textile Strike of 1912. These events contributed to the growth of the labor movement and the eventual passage of laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.\n\nThe Homestead Strike also had a lasting impact on the city of Pittsburgh, where it took place.
