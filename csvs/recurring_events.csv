To find your dance is to find yourself, at your most fluid and creative level.

While the practice itself is the essence of simplicity, it has the power to catalyze deep healing and creative expression. The primary teaching of this work is: If you put the psyche in motion, it will heal itself.

The five rhythms are Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical and Stillness. They come together to create the Wave, a movement meditation practice.

Remember Graffiti? It used to market itself as ""the Greenwich Village Scene of Pittsburgh."" Do you even know about the Greenwich Village scene? If you don't you should.

Yes. Even the legendary voices of the Greenwich Village scene passed a hat and split the proceeds. And they came out to support each other. Not everyone got famous. Not everyone had a hit record. But they made something happen.

Genius emerges from community.

So if you write songs, get off your butt and get out and play.
